These are the commands that I use to configure my PC's UEFI to load my Linux kernel. Please help yourself.

* command.sh - The command to just load the kernel normally.

* e4rat-learn.sh - The command to load the kernel with e4rat in learning mode.

* e4rat-run.sh - The command that loads the kernel with e4rat in preload mode (what should be used all the time after e4rat has learned your startup).
